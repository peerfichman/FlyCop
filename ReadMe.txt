Demo of a web application designed to improve police track over traffic violations
FlyCop is a traffic enforcement system based on an autonomous drone. 
FlyCop captures suspected activity on the road and indicates law enforcement personnel about the violation in real time. 
Using the system, law enforcement users can send drones for different missions, adjust mission settings at any time, track the dronesâ€™ activity and view all captured violations.


A deployed version of the system can be views at:
